# The Anti-Social Network

## A falsely functioning social network

This project aims to show badly implemented features. Most of the features should be commonly used and wide spread features in the world of webapplications. To showcase those implementations, a social network context was chosen. Hence the name The Anti-Social Network. Some features will be implemented just to annoy the user, just for fun or due to the given amount of stupidity.

A list of features to come:

<ul>
  <li>
     a widely used feature is the login feature. Here the user will get the username of the entered password instead of a wrong password prompt.
  </li>
  <li>
     the user will be asked for microphone and camera access frequently.
  </li>
  <li>
    badly triggered success messages/warnings.
